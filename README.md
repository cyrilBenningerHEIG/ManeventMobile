# Manevent Mobile 

Manevent Mobile is a simple application written on [ionic/angular] framework which allows the following set of interactions : 

1. to add / modify / delete an event  
2. to add / modify / delete a user 
3. a real-time communication by an event between subscribed users 

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 12.x

## Usage

bash

git clone https://github.com/cyrilBenningerHEIG/ManeventMobile.git

cd ManeventMobile

npm install

ionic serve

The application starts at the PORT:8100 of your local server : [http://localhost:8100](http://localhost:8100).

If you want to use the application on smartphone, you should run the application in a developer mode. We are using a [Ionic DevApp] utility for that. Use "ionic serve --devapp" instead of "ionic start" and locate it on the Ionic Dev application.
